# DATA CLEANING - SQL PROJECT

## CLEANING DATA WITH SQL
Cleaning data is one of the most important aspect of data analysis, and there are lots of tools you can use to do it. 
For this project, I used MSSQL to clean up data about houses in Nashville to get it ready for further analysis. 
You can find the Nashville Housing Data using this [link](https://github.com/dannieRope/Data-Cleaning-SQL-PROJECT/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.csv).

Here's what I did to clean up the data:

- First, I brought the data into MS Server Studio.
- Then, I looked at all the rows and columns in the dataset.
- I checked to make sure each type of data was in the right format.
- I found and got rid of any empty or missing values, either by taking them out or putting in new values.
- I made sure there were no duplicate rows.
- If needed, I changed some values in the columns.
- I split up some columns if they had too much stuff in them.
- I got rid of any columns that didn't really matter.

You can find the SQL script I used for cleaning the data [here](https://github.com/dannieRope/Data-Cleaning-SQL-PROJECT/blob/main/SQL_script.sql).
